# Singleton presentation review

- **Author**: Kyrylo Vasylenko

- **Reviewer**: Polina Shlepakova

- **Teacher**: Volodymyr Boublik

## Structure

**Pros**:

- Links to images and used resources are mentioned

- Page number and creation date are present

- Text and code are readable

- Minimalistic slides

- Difficult to understand slides have comments

**Cons**:

- No diagrams (except pattern relashionships). However, Singleton pattern is quite easy to understand without them.

- Information on slides + comments to some of them is not enough to understand presentation without the presenter.

## Content

**Pros**:

- Main idea is explained well

- Pattern relationships as well as antipatterns is mentioned

- Implementation is explained, moving from the worst one to the best

- Multithreading + Singleton is implemented, which is great

- Possible mistakes are reviewed

- Applicability is mentioned

- A pinch of humour is nice

## Summary

Singleton is usually perceived as a simple pattern. For many people it is the first pattern they encounter or learn. The implementation is (usually) short and seems easy to understand.

Because of this perceived simplicity, Singleton often gets implemented without much thinking, leading to mistakes.

What I liked the most about Kyryll's presentation is that he reviewed the popular implementation and architecture mistakes that arise when using Singleton pattern.
