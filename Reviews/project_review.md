# Project review

- **Author**: Kyrylo Vasylenko

- **Reviewer**: Polina Shlepakova

- **Teacher**: Volodymyr Boublik

## Notes

- Convenient that code is distributed among packages

- Project has history on github, which is great as it's easier to read it commit by commit, rather than in one big chunk

- Not all class names communicate class' purpose clearly (and they don't have comments to fix that). For example, the difference between `TransportPool` and `TransportStorage` is unclear, and one has to dig deeper into the code to notice it.

- A few possible implementations are shown and compared

- A thread-safe implementation is shown
