## Content

**Pros**:

## Summary

Object pool is described neither in the GoF book, nor in the Russian version of "Design patterns explained simply" by Alexander Shvets (it is present in the English version, which is very short). So presenter had to gather and structure information himself, and I believe that he managed to do it well, making presentation interesting and useful.
